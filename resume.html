              <ul>
                <li>Joined Quick Commerce (Darkstores Grocery Delivery) as an Engineering Manager.</li>
                <li>Leading 3 product teams in Supply Chain & WMS (Warehouse Management System) tribe who own services for supplier workflows like SKU pricing, discounts, placing orders, warehouse or distribution center deliveries/transfers, etc.</li>
                <li>Initially engaged in the architectural decisions of deprecating legacy QCommerce WMS system and had a hands-on experience for decoupling the functionalities into multiple micro-services written in golang, python & java.</li>
                <li>Strongly believe that problems need transparency at first, so I focused on showing trends to teams regardless of their workflows or methodologies. This enabled teams to ideate on improvements rather than being handed solutions, nudging them to own the problem and drive change.</li>
                <li>Transitioned to Developer Platform with a focus on developer productivity and optimizing release strategies to help engineers innovate faster and reduce toil so they can focus on what really matters.</li>
                <li>Was part of the team that architected the first versions of the Developer Platform at Delivery Hero, designing a golden path for developing and deploying applications with enough defaults for infrastructure to reduce engineers' toil and cognitive load, allowing them to focus on impactful work.</li>
                <li>Currently leading the change management process for adopting AI productivity tools across Delivery Hero's 4,000 engineers, including tools like Gemini Code Assist, to enhance workflows and innovation capabilities.</li>
